# SIR model of large-scale COVID-19 Pandemic Simulation

### The following page depicts modelling of large-scale COVID-19 pandemic as a part of the Modelling of Discrete Systems course on AGH UST

Basic assumptions:
We're using SIR agent model to represent people living within cities, moving between them at constant travel rate. People randomly move within the cities or travel to another in an iteration.
